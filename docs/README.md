# Winter 2026 Personal Project - Turn Based Game

## Credits
Developed, maintained, coded, and designed by Matthew James Romano.
AI assistance was used only for planning and outlining project ideas; all coding and implementation were completed independently.

## Project Description
This project is a full-stack application combining a React frontend and a C++ backend.
It is a turn-based strategy game, inspired by classic board games, designed as a proof of concept to demonstrate my skills in both front-end and back-end development.

The game showcases:
  - Tactical turn-based combat with multiple units per player.
  - Energy management mechanics influencing which units can act each turn.
  - Strategic map control, including power squares that provide energy bonuses.
  - Dynamic board interaction and deterministic game logic.
This project is focused on demonstrating programming concepts rather than delivering a complete commercial game.

## Setup Instructions
Currently, no setup is required because no code is implemented.

## Learning Goals Demonstrated
  - Structuring a full-stack application combining C++ and React.
  - Implementing a turn-based deterministic engine.
  - Managing shared resources and enforcing game rules.
  - Designing a scalable game architecture suitable for future expansions.
