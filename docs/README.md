# Winter 2026 Personal Project	

## Credits
Developed, maintained, coded, and created by Matthew James Romano. AI was used in this project but only for the planning/outline.

## Project Description
This project is a full stack application that combines both react frontend elements and a C++ backend. This project is a turn based, strategy game much like the board games of the olden days. This project is less of a full game and more of a proof of concept or demonstration of my learning from the first year and a half of my schooling.
