# Game Rules
There are 2 players per game, and eventually an AI will be added so that single player is possible. 
The grid is rectangular and varies in size depending on the players’ choice, and eventually I will implement random grids with obstacles. 
For now, stats are going to be as basic as possible, health, energy/ap and damage. 
Attacking and moving cost energy, and each turn some energy is regained. Distance that a player can move is determined by their energy, 1 energy equals 1 space you can move. 
Attacks work a little differently, a player can only attack adjacent squares, each attack also costs energy. For now, Things will stay as simple as they can get.
